    <p>
      In the tumultuous first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, filmmaker Adam
      Bhala Lough delved into the heart of a growing movement that would come to
      be known as the “alt-right.” His documentary, “Alt-Right: Age of Rage,”
      provides a raw and unflinching look at the ideological components,
      leaders, and tragic events that unfolded during this period.

    <h1>The Rise of the Alt-Right</h1>

    <p>
      The term “alt-right” encompasses a political grouping that combines
      elements of racism, white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and populism. It has
      been embraced by white supremacists and nationalist groups who emphasize
      the preservation and protection of the white race in the United States.
      But what fuels this movement, and how did it gain momentum?
    </p>

    <h1>The Charlottesville Tragedy</h1>
    <p>
      The documentary centers around the “Unite the Right” rally held in
      Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017. Organized by the alternative
      right, this rally aimed to show support for preserving Confederate
      monuments and memorials. However, the event turned violent when white
      nationalists clashed with counter-demonstrators, many of whom identified
      as Antifa (anti-fascists).

    <h2>!Charlottesville Rally</h2>

    <p>
      The violence culminated in the tragic death of Heather Heyer, a
      counter-protester who was run down by a car driven by a neo-Nazi
      supporter. The aftermath of this event shook the nation and highlighted
      the deep divisions within American society.
    </p>

    <h1>Ideological Roots and Anger</h1>
    <p>Lough explores the factors that fueled the alt-right movement:</p>
    <br />White Identity: The ideology of the alt-right cannot be separated from
    discussions about white identity. Many followers believe that white people
    are being marginalized and pushed aside by people of color, immigrants,
    Muslims, and even women. They long for a return to a perceived golden era
    when traditional gender roles prevailed. <br />Rejection of Mainstream
    Conservatism: The alt-right rejects mainstream Republicanism, considering it
    a betrayal of their cause. They view mainstream Republicans as having sold
    out their party.
    <h1>Social Media and Emboldenment</h1>
    <p>
      Lough also sheds light on how white nationalist social media platforms
      bolstered the alt-right movement. Additionally, President Trump’s
      controversial comments following the Charlottesville violence—where he
      placed blame “on many sides”—emboldened the movement further.

    <p>
      “Alt-Right: Age of Rage” captures a pivotal moment in American history.
      The images from the rally, including Heather Heyer’s tragic death, serve
      as a stark reminder of the cyclical grip of violent racism.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we grapple with the legacy of this movement, understanding its roots
      and motivations becomes crucial. Lough’s documentary invites viewers to
      confront uncomfortable truths and engage in meaningful dialogue about the
      future of our nation.
