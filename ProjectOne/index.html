      A Tale of Two Cities is a historical novel published in 1859 by Charles
      Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.
      The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long
      imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris, and his release to live in London
      with his daughter Lucie whom he had never met. The story is set against
      the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of
      Terror.
